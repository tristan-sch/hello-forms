# Javascript In The Browser - Forms

This is my assignment for Module 3 Javascript In The Browser - Forms

- Go to the [guide](https://io.tskoli.dev/guides/5f1332d9b279dc27c467cacb)

- Go to the [live preview](https://tristan-sch.github.io/hello-forms/)

## What did I do?

I just followed this [tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-javascript-form-validation-by-making-a-form/) from the guide.

Due to lack of time, I did not do something fancy but I wanted to understand everything.

I changed with the content of the form and the icons.
